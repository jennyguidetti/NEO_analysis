This project uses JavaScript and Node to analyse data from NASA about Near Earth Objects (NEOs) in five separate steps. The JSON data contains 202 objects with information about the properties of each NEO including the observed magnitude (h_mag), the minimum orbit intersection distance (MOID), the perihelion distance (q), the aphelion distance (Q), the orbital period (period_yr), the orbital inclination (i_deg), whether the NEO is a potentially hazardous asteroid (PHA) and the orbit class. The report included details how the data was loaded, analysed using functions, reformatted, saved and tested for performance.
